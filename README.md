# google-trend-using-pytrend_new
Python script using PyTrends to effectively automate large data point collection of list companies from Google Trends
This Python script will help in automating the process of data point collection from Google Trends.
This python script will read a list of keywords from a CSV file and look them up on Google Trend and return Google Trend data points. 
As you dig deep into Google Trend you will see that Google Trend has bifurcated data into different categories like Topic, Company, music, food, animal, etc. 
This code is developed to refine your search and return your exact data points for your respective search category called MID codes.
You need to create a CSV file for all the list of keywords you wish to extract from Google Trends (the words have to be exact else Google will throw an error).
This script will use the keywords from the CSV file and search for the keywords on Google Trend and in the last step will return a CSV file with all Google Data points.
